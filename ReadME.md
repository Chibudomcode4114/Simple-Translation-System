# Simple Translation System

This repository contains a simple translation system implemented in Python. The system translates text from one language to another using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Development Phase 1: Basic Translation System

### Overview

In this initial development phase, we created a basic translation system capable of translating text from Igbo to English using pre-trained translation models. The system was implemented as a Python script with a command-line interface.

### Features

- **Translation Functionality**: The system translates text from Igbo to English.
- **Pre-trained Models**: It utilizes pre-trained translation models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Users interact with the system via a simple command-line interface.

### Usage

To use the translation system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher recommended).
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script `translation.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to enter the text you want to translate.

### Example

```bash
python translation.py
